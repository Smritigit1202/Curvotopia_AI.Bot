Project Overview

Welcome to Curvetopia! This project is all about transforming rough 2D shapes into their most beautiful and complete forms. We focus on three key tasks:

1. Shape Identification and Beautification 🌟  
   First, we identify the shape from a set of points, and then we work on beautifying it—turning those rough edges into smooth, regular shapes like circles, ellipses, or polygons.

   Watch the process in action:

2. Symmetry Detection 🔍  
   Next, we detect symmetry in the shape—whether it's horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Understanding the symmetry helps us ensure the shape is perfectly balanced.

    how we detect symmetry:

3. Completing Incomplete Shapes 🧩  
   Finally, we complete any missing parts of the shape. If the shape is incomplete, we fill in the gaps to create a perfect, whole figure.
