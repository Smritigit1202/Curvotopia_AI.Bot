# Curvotopia_AI.Bot



Project Overview

Welcome to Curvetopia! This project is all about transforming rough 2D shapes into their most beautiful and complete forms. We focus on three key tasks:

1. Shape Identification and Beautification üåü  
   First, we identify the shape from a set of points, and then we work on beautifying it‚Äîturning those rough edges into smooth, regular shapes like circles, ellipses, or polygons.

   Watch the process in action:

   

3. Symmetry Detection üîç  
   Next, we detect symmetry in the shape‚Äîwhether it's horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Understanding the symmetry helps us ensure the shape is perfectly balanced.

   See how we detect symmetry:

   

5. Completing Incomplete Shapes üß©  
   Finally, we complete any missing parts of the shape. If the shape is incomplete, we fill in the gaps to create a perfect, whole figure.

   Watch how we complete shapes:
